    <description>The Question object represents the question. Contains a link to survey, the general position of the question in the list, and a visibility flag (true by default). Question visibility is important if we have a related question and the dependent question should not be visible when the conditions are met. Contains the question text itself, the question reuse flag, and its type (picklist, radiobutton, checkbox, etc.).</description>
